[Website Waters, Stage 1:Website Basics, with Nick Pettit]

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hi, I'm Nick, and welcome to Website Waters. 

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In this first island, we're going to make our very first website. 

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If you have no previous experience building websites, don't worry. 

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We'll start at the very beginning and work our way forward. 

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
All you need is a computer, which we'll use to type up our code. 

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
By the end of this island, 

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
we'll have created a complete website. 

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Allison went ahead and designed a mockup

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
of what the final site will look like. 

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now it's our job to turn it into code. 

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This site is for a fictional bakery

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
called Smells Like Bakin. 

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's dive right in and try a little bit of coding. 

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This program that I'm going to be typing in

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
is called a text editor. 

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We'll learn more about text editing programs in upcoming videos,

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
but for now, just try to watch and absorb. 

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let's type in the headline Smells Like Bakin. 

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's great, but we'll have to identify this line

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
so that our web browser will know that it's a headline

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and not something else, like a paragraph or an image. 

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
To do this, we'll use special markings called tags. 

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Wrapping an H1 tag around the text, Smells Like Bakin, 

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
tells the browser that this text

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
is a level-one header. 

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So we'll go ahead and type &lt;h1&gt;, 

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and then we'll do the same thing on the other side by typing in &lt;/h1&gt;.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Now, let's switch over to our web browser and open the page that we created. 

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
When we refresh, we should now see

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
the headline that we typed. 

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And there it is--Smells Like Bakin. 

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Now you go ahead and try it.
