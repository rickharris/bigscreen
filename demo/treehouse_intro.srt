2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,000
So, I'm really interested in the web

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and I always thought it would be really cool to learn more about technology,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
so I signed up for Treehouse.

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,000
Every day, I log in, watch a video, take a quiz, and earn a badge.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,100
Now I know something new that I didn't know yesterday,

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,130
and the things that I'm learning are all marketable skills.

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,440
Today, I published my first website,

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,440
and tomorrow I'll work on an iPhone app.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,930
Treehouse is an online technology school,

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,520
but it's not like any kind of school you've ever experienced.

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,670
Instead of teaching boring, out-of-date material,

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,100
Treehouse guides you, step-by-step, through real projects

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,330
to teach you exactly what you need to know.

15
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,290
Build a mobile app, or launch a web startup.

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,730
You have real goals, and Treehouse is focused on helping you achieve them.

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,320
With just a little work every day, they'll take you where you want to go.

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,580
Treehouse is a better way to learn technology.
